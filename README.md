to help myself to remember English vocabulary

Because I need to prepare my IELT exam. So I designed this page to help me remember English Vocabularies. This web can add new vacabularies, delete, update and search previous vocabularies.In addtioion, it also provides exams. It needs to go with MySQL to store data into the database. I put it on my free website. I don't make the login function avaliable because I still use this website to add new data. After downloading my code, you can customize your own login function. Download the sql file and import it into Mysql and you can use the database structure.
